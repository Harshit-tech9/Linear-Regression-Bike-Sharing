# Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing 
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## General Information
- The Project is aimed to create a Multiple Linear regression model to predict the bike rentals of BoomBikes. 
- Here we are trying to understand the factors influencing bike rentals.
- In the dataset, we have different parameters here management is trying to understand the variables/parameters which influence the bike rentals most and can take business decisions accordingly.
- The dataset is taken from Fanaee-T, Hadi, and Gama, Joao, "Event labeling combining ensemble detectors and background knowledge", Progress in Artificial Intelligence (2013): pp. 1-15, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, doi:10.1007/s13748-013-0040-3.

## Conclusions
- The variable which influences the bike rentals are temperature, Month, and season, all three variables are highly correlated to each other. 
- Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy in kind of weather situation there are highest bike rentals.
- The bike rentals have increased from 2018 to 2019 but we can observe one thing there is a sharp drop in bike rentals during the vacation period.
- In the winter season bike rentals are high while in spring they are low.
